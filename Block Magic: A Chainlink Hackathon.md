Ringle creates liquidity pools for asset pairs (NFTs and other base tokens), utilizing the AMM (Automated Market Maker) model and the Constant Product formula (xy = k). This ensures high liquidity for NFT trading.

**Key Points:**

> **Providing Liquidity to Asset Pairs:**
- In an NFT AMM, providing liquidity to asset pairs makes the trading experience smoother and more reliable. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees, encouraging more users to provide liquidity. This increased liquidity helps stabilize prices.

> **Buying and Selling NFTs:**
- Users can sell NFTs through ERC-721 tokens and buy fractionalized tokens of NFTs through ERC-20 tokens.

> **Guessing Game with Chainlink VRF:**
- New traders can engage in a simple game, ‚ÄòGuess and Claim Free NFT.‚Äô Leveraging Chainlink VRF, the game generates a fully random and fair number, giving users a chance to win free NFTs. Chainlink automation enhances our platform's functionality by distributing free NFTs, improving the customer experience.

### Result:
- Not Yet

---
### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) Although I carried out all project ideation and planning, I was lacking in leading and guiding the team members. So, one of the development team members focused on leading the development team and the best results were achieved.
2) This is related to number 1, but since this was the first time planning a DeFi service called AMM, I think I was unable to lead the team members because I lacked understanding and knowledge of the DeFi financial system itself, not the UI/UX and functional aspects.
3) It was unfortunate that the meeting with my team members could not proceed properly because my English conversation skills were still lacking.
4) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- I was satisfied and thought that good results were possible because the development was led by a person with knowledge of DeFi services and technical aspects.
- This was the first time for the development team members to directly utilize Chainlink technology (VRF, CCIP), Sponsor Track (Scroll, Polygon), and NFT AMM technology, and we were very satisfied with the fact that they were able to apply it while studying and complete the product. .
- I am very grateful to the development team members for completing the hackathon with good results within the period and developing my idea into a good product even during the busy exam period.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I believe that the IP industry market has high future value, and I learned that many services in the new IP era are expected to be released in the future.
- I learned that what is important in the IP industry is the creator's ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing, and that the protocol that authenticates and proves them is the story protocol, and that the function to pay royalties accordingly can be included in the contract. I learned.
