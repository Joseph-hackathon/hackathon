Ringle creates liquidity pools for asset pairs (NFTs and other base tokens), utilizing the AMM (Automated Market Maker) model and the Constant Product formula (xy = k). This ensures high liquidity for NFT trading.

**Key Points:**

> **Providing Liquidity to Asset Pairs:**
- In an NFT AMM, providing liquidity to asset pairs makes the trading experience smoother and more reliable. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees, encouraging more users to provide liquidity. This increased liquidity helps stabilize prices.

> **Buying and Selling NFTs:**
- Users can sell NFTs through ERC-721 tokens and buy fractionalized tokens of NFTs through ERC-20 tokens.

> **Guessing Game with Chainlink VRF:**
- New traders can engage in a simple game, ‚ÄòGuess and Claim Free NFT.‚Äô Leveraging Chainlink VRF, the game generates a fully random and fair number, giving users a chance to win free NFTs. Chainlink automation enhances our platform's functionality by distributing free NFTs, improving the customer experience.

### Result:
- Not Yet

### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement:
1) This hackathon was not my idea, but was carried out as an idea from my team members. So it took me a while to understand the idea, and I was disappointed that I couldn't find something I could do.
2) I felt that the creativity of the idea was a little lacking in the 50:50 ratio. This is because 50% helped to quickly introduce the existing Web2 service podcast into the new blockchain market, which develops and upgrades to meet the new web3 trend market, while the remaining 50% was a service that was previously used, so it is a new technology for ideas. I think creativity was very lacking.  This is because it is highly likely that the podcast service had similar ideas to ours.
3) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Overall, I am satisfied because the UI/UX is very pretty and beautifully created, and the development was completed as a good project.
- Although I did not have a large part in the hackathon, I am very satisfied because the developer team members communicated with each other and completed the development perfectly.
---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I believe that the IP industry market has high future value, and I learned that many services in the new IP era are expected to be released in the future.
- I learned that what is important in the IP industry is the creator's ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing, and that the protocol that authenticates and proves them is the story protocol, and that the function to pay royalties accordingly can be included in the contract. I learned.
