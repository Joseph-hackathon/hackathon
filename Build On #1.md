## Overview
**DataDiscovery** is a data asset management platform that collects, visualizes, and manages survey and on-chain data, allowing companies to purchase and utilize it.

- **Provide Secure and Reliable Data:** Upload survey data and on-chain data to Avail DA for safe storage and management, then upload and manage it by validating the existence and reliability of the data using ZK Encryption.

- **Access Decentralized On-chain Data:** There is a vast amount of on-chain data, but it is often difficult to extract actionable insights with current tools. DataDiscovery simplifies this process by aggregating and visualizing various data with Coin API included in Quicknode Marketplace Add-On.

- **Buy Data:** Businesses can purchase useful, pre-filtered data directly with PYUSD for marketing, customer research, and other business needs. Additionally, commissions from the data sold are PYUSD rewarded to users who complete the survey.

- **Make Better Decisions with Data:** DataDiscovery allows businesses to leverage valuable insights from surveys and on-chain data to improve their strategies, understand consumer behavior, and drive growth.

- **Black/Whitelist Wallet Address Data:** Multiple wallet addresses are blacklisted/whitelisted and a list of their data is provided.

### Result
- Not yet

### Reason for falling (Feedback from NEAR Protocol judges)
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement
1) In terms of retrieving on-chain data using the Quicknode API, I was disappointed because I thought it was insufficient to retrieve various types of data and more detailed meaningful data.
2) It would have been nice to have content that imports various data, filters and preprocesses the data on its own, and provides it in a new data format, but it was unfortunate that there was not enough time to develop the content.
3) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- The data itself from the act of receiving surveys from users is the most meaningful feedback for companies and data that can be used for UX and marketing, so I am proud to have developed a platform where such survey data can be easily obtained, and I am proud to provide it to my team members. thank you
- Survey data contains user information, so we were thinking about how to secure this. A team member suggested the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãencrypting data using zk in Avail and uploading it to the on-chain, so we could develop and complete it and show it as a demo. It was really nice to have it.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- Through this hackathon, I learned that Quicknode provides its own marketplace that seems to provide API applications to various data services, such as the Chrome Web Store, so that you can utilize the data collected by various services as well as APIs.
