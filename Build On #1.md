# Build On
`Review of participation in the 22 hackathon.`

[Demo](http://datadiscovery.online:3103/) | [Pitchdeck](https://www.figma.com/deck/fXBn89zONz4B4siNLnr647) | [Github](https://github.com/hackathemy/datadiscovery) | [Video](https://youtu.be/2QSdw99h898)

## Overview
**DataDiscovery** is a data asset management platform that collects, visualizes, and manages survey and on-chain data, allowing companies to purchase and utilize it.

<br></br>

- **Provide Secure and Reliable Data:** Upload survey data and on-chain data to Avail DA for safe storage and management, then upload and manage it by validating the existence and reliability of the data using ZK Encryption.

- **Access Decentralized On-chain Data:** There is a vast amount of on-chain data, but it is often difficult to extract actionable insights with current tools. DataDiscovery simplifies this process by aggregating and visualizing various data with Coin API included in Quicknode Marketplace Add-On.

- **Buy Data:** Businesses can purchase useful, pre-filtered data directly with PYUSD for marketing, customer research, and other business needs. Additionally, commissions from the data sold are PYUSD rewarded to users who complete the survey.

- **Make Better Decisions with Data:** DataDiscovery allows businesses to leverage valuable insights from surveys and on-chain data to improve their strategies, understand consumer behavior, and drive growth.

- **Black/Whitelist Wallet Address Data:** Multiple wallet addresses are blacklisted/whitelisted and a list of their data is provided.

### Result
- Not yet

### Reason for falling (Feedback from NEAR Protocol judges)
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement
1) We completed all of the smart contracts and AI models for each part, but in the process of integrating with the front end, there was a problem with the integration of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodel due to the high usage environment on PCs such as GPUs, so it was unfortunate that it could not be completed as a perfect platform.
2) This Near Protocol Hackathon had many sponsored tracks that focused on AI technology, which was the core of this hackathon, but among the sponsored tracks, we used **ZettaBlock** and **Public AI**'s API to import on-chain data and train it in our AI model to model it. We tried to improve and collect and pre-process a lot of data, but there was not enough data related to the vulnerabilities we wanted, and there was a problem integrating the API, so it was disappointing that we could not utilize the sponsor tracks.
3) Our MVP was to complete all of the API docs page, file upload page, and admin console page, but this MVP was not in a phase that could be completed within the period and had many overloaded functions, so it was difficult to manage these schedules. As a product manager, I was a bit lacking and was disappointed.
4) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- With only a few hours left until the submission deadline, there were issues with our platform not being able to integrate with the front end and AI model, but we did not give up and created a pitch deck to explain what our project was and a fully developed AI model. I was fortunate and glad that I was able to record a demo with the flow because I was able to show the code and that it was working properly.
- Although it was not integrated with the front end, we had developed all of the code for the NEAR smart contract and the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodel that analyzes vulnerabilities, so we had a GitHub repo where we could demonstrate our performance as much as possible within the hackathon period, and our The project was 90% complete, so I was really grateful and happy because there were team members who worked hard and worked hard to develop it.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- Even in a little over a month, we realized and learned that it is important to minimize the MVP features we want to create as much as possible. 
- It may be easy as a planner, but in terms of development, I knew that it takes a long time to analyze various aspects such as the integration process and the API linking process, create the architecture, and ensure that the flow operates properly, so I decided to spend a little more time on MVP. I learned that it is also necessary to prepare an MVP only for edge points that can reduce the project to a minimum and maximize the quality and performance of the project.
- Through this Near Hackathon, I learned that Near Protocol wants projects on how to utilize current AI and blockchain technology more effectively and is trying to actively utilize AI technology. And currently, Near AI has not yet developed a model, but I am looking forward to creating Near's own AI model by collecting data with various sponsors who participated this time.
