### Reason for falling (Feedback from WallectConnect judges):
- Not yet

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) Honestly, I don‚Äôt feel like there was anything disappointing about this hackathon. However, that doesn't mean that there are no regrets because it was perfect. This hackathon was simply carried out with the feeling of presenting an easy and fast service, showing what our service is through a pitch deck, and selling our service to companies if we actually do business, so it was disappointing from a development perspective and any other aspect. You cannot feel or find the dot.
2) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- When conducting market research in the beginning, we learned that overseas restaurants do not use similar services such as OrderWrap, such as menu table ordering platforms and machines. In addition, there is a similar platform in Korea, T-Order, and they are also just entering the overseas market, so I knew that there had been nothing that had gained good popularity or results overseas yet. So, in terms of marketability, it felt a bit like a blue ocean, but our service showed the advantage of being the simplest and easiest to pay and order, and the pitch deck material design and content composition were not focused on problems and solutions, but rather our service. I think we were able to receive such good results as a result of organizing the content simply by showing what the OrderWrap service is and what it is like.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- Sometimes, if we develop a simple and easy service and present our service by expressing simple and clear goals, problems, solutions, etc. through presentation materials such as a pitch deck, the judges may be more comfortable accepting and understanding it. I learned a ton from the results.
