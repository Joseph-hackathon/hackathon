### Overview:
NFT.info is an innovative platform that combines blockchain technology with distributed file systems to ensure the security and accessibility of data. 
It is designed to securely store and access data for digital assets such as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). 
While many current NFT platforms use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this method has issues where data cannot be found if the seed is inactive. 
NFT.info addresses these issues to provide a more reliable service for users.

**Key Points:**
Services that use IPFS build their own separate CDN to guarantee speed or data. 
Or record the image offchain nftinfo.online (NFT.info) is not only recorded on the blockchain using Celestia DA, 
but is also designed so that there is no need to build a separate CDN service.

### Result:
- Not Yet

---
### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet
---
### Areas for improvement:
1) Since the hackathon was held for 3 days and 2 nights and we stayed up all night, it was necessary to come to our senses when we were confused and focus even more on the detailed explanation of the project, the functions used, and the process for that function.
2) Need to identify trends in the latest blockchain market.
3) When using AI, it is necessary to study and explain how to process AI, collect data, and learn.
4) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- It was nice to see a high-quality project come out in a short period of time.
- It was a great experience to meet and communicate with people currently working and developing in the blockchain industry.
- It was nice to be able to directly see presentations on various projects.
- Although it was my 6th hackathon, it was nice to feel that I needed to improve and learn more.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- When creating a project using AI, not only an explanation from the blockchain and service perspective is needed, but also a detailed explanation of the creation process and functions of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodel itself.
- In blockchain hackathons, the nature of projects in which on-chain transactions occur is of greater interest and focus, so more functions should be added to on-chain projects than to projects that are off-chain.
