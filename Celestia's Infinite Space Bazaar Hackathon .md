### Overview:
NFT.info is an innovative platform that combines blockchain technology with distributed file systems to ensure the security and accessibility of data. 
It is designed to securely store and access data for digital assets such as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). 
While many current NFT platforms use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this method has issues where data cannot be found if the seed is inactive. 
NFT.info addresses these issues to provide a more reliable service for users.

**Key Points:**
Services that use IPFS build their own separate CDN to guarantee speed or data. 
Or record the image offchain nftinfo.online (NFT.info) is not only recorded on the blockchain using Celestia DA, 
but is also designed so that there is no need to build a separate CDN service.

### Result:
- Not Yet

---
### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet
---
### Areas for improvement:
1) In terms of schedule management, we should have continued to monitor and proceed with development work according to the period, but it was insufficient.
2) There was a lack of decision-making power to decide whether to add features. (It was necessary to manage the schedule and figure out whether it could be completed within the period.)
3) There was a lack of leadership to direct work tasks to team members.
4) Because there was a lack of understanding of the project overall, it was difficult to lead the project.
5) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Even though I lacked an overall understanding of the project, it was good because I was able to understand it all the way through and complete the development with good results.
- I am glad that I was able to understand and understand a little more about what I am currently lacking.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I was able to directly learn and experience the ecosystem related to Celestia and investigate and understand the ecosystem related to DA.
- I learned about the current problems and limitations of IPFS and how to solve them through DA through this hackathon and hackathon product ideas.
