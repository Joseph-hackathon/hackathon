## Project

### Motivation
Xchain shop is a second-hand transaction service that is not widely used in overseas environments and is not yet active, but it would be good to utilize this in reverse to enter this blue ocean-like second-hand transaction P2P transaction platform for the first time and participate in a market where there is a lack of competitors, effectively and uniquely show our own service, and activate this P2P transaction a little more, and provide a way for users to easily make profits and resell various leftover products that are too good to throw away or new but unused products to make a little profit, or to quickly obtain necessary items from people and areas around them.
Therefore, rather than focusing on fundamental issues, we have seen a successful case in the Korean market where a GPS-based second-hand transaction service called Carrot Market was successful and well-operated, so this second-hand transaction service is being provided to introduce a cryptocurrency payment system in overseas markets, to be reborn, to challenge the overseas second-hand transaction market, and to help users easily purchase and obtain necessary products around them.

### Key Features
1. **Cryptocurrency Payment System**
   - Supports stablecoins and multiple blockchains, enabling users to make secure and affordable transactions with fees as low as 2-3%.

2. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**
   - Utilizes **Klaster** for EVM-compatible networks and **Agoric** for Cosmos IBC networks, allowing seamless transactions with USDC across different ecosystems.

3. **User-Friendly Access**
   - With **Particle Connect SDK**, users can easily sign up using email or social media, making the platform accessible and straightforward.

4. **Enhanced Security with Escrow**
   - Escrow services ensure secure transactions, protecting users against scams in P2P second-hand trades.

5. **Intuitive UX for Quick Transactions**
   - Simple listing and purchasing processes with an easy-to-navigate interface, allowing users to quickly post items and make purchases.

6. **GPS-Based Local Trading**
   - Facilitates location-based transactions so users can find and purchase items within their local community, promoting trust and convenience.

### Result
- ü•à Agoric Orchestration - 2nd Place
- üõí Honorable Mentions - SEDA

### Reason for falling (Feedback from XRPL judges)
- "The idea is very interesting, as it allows people to transact real goods with crypto or digital assets. The other challenge is solving the regulatory aspect and how to navigate regulations to ensure it can legally operate in various jurisdictions.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis product would be appealing if users need a borderless payment method, but it will require strong management for the delivery of physical goods. Overall, I'm really looking forward to the development of this product.‚Äù

### Areas for improvement
1) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- Although the function to bridge the EVM chain was not fully implemented within the period, the code was structured to a certain extent, and when pitching this, the goal and timeline of continuous development were clearly set, so the EVM side chain was launched. I'm glad I was able to get good results on the track.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- I learned that the results may vary depending on the presentation, presentation materials, and document content. We did not receive any awards when we submitted this service to the previous Ripple hackathon. However, this time, we reorganized again, revised and submitted presentation materials and documents, and were able to obtain good results.
- I think it is a good idea to analyze and make a strategic decision about the track you choose when submitting. We submitted the Non-EVM track in the previous hackathon, but this time we chose and submitted the EVM track and got good results.
