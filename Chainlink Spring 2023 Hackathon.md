## Review of participation in the first hackathon.

### Overview:
The hackathon was organized by Chainlink and is held annually.
We met through Discord and decided to form a team consisting only of Koreans.
- 1 PM, 2 frontend developers, 1 backend developer, 1 smart contract developer

### Track:
- Chainlink Top Qulity Prizes $20,000 ($500)

### Project:
- Trypto - Web3-based social platform for travel

### Result:
- Winner (A total of 40 teams were selected)

### Areas for improvement:
1) Decision-making as a PM role (initial stage)
2) Quality of the presentation materials for the presentation video. (+English pronunciation)
3) Lack of awareness regarding the PM role due to it being the first hackathon.

### Positive aspects:
1) Gained understanding of the PM role during the hackathon.
2) Although it took 2 weeks to finalize the idea, the develop timeline progressed as planned without any issues.
3) Direct communication with the develop team members.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- The importance of decision-making and leadership in the PM role.
- Need for skills in I.A, product func docs, Wire-Frame, User Flow, and overall project understanding and organization.
- The significance of gathering relevant information
