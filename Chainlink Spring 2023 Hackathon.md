## Review of participation in the first hackathon.

### Overview:
The ways to preserve memories are through personal memories or pictures. However, relying solely on personal memories has its limitations, which is why many people choose to digitally capture their memories through pictures. Nevertheless, even photographs have their limitations. Pictures stored in certain locations can be deleted or lost, and when the pictures are deleted, the associated memory can no longer be found again. However, by utilizing blockchain technology, we can ensure that memories are preserved indefinitely, immune to deletion or disappearance. The data associated with each memory is recorded on the blockchain, guaranteeing its eternal existence. We combine the concept of memories with travel services and offer a platform called Trypto, where memories are stored on the blockchain.

### Result:
- Winner (A total of 40 teams were selected)

### Areas for improvement:
1) Decision-making as a PM role (initial stage)
2) Quality of the presentation materials for the presentation video. (+English pronunciation)
3) Lack of awareness regarding the PM role due to it being the first hackathon.

### Positive aspects:
1) Gained understanding of the PM role during the hackathon.
2) Although it took 2 weeks to finalize the idea, the develop timeline progressed as planned without any issues.
3) Direct communication with the develop team members.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- The importance of decision-making and leadership in the PM role.
- Need for skills in I.A, product func docs, Wire-Frame, User Flow, and overall project understanding and organization.
- The significance of gathering relevant information
