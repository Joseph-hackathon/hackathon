## Review of participation in the third hackathon.

### Overview:
Many IT and software-related service projects initially generate high interest and enthusiasm. However, over time, with the emergence of new technologies and services, these earlier projects often lose attention and stop receiving updates. For instance, in hackathons, only a few projects among many submissions receive awards, while the rest tend to vanish without further updates. Even the awarded projects frequently cease to receive updates after receiving the prize money. Consequently, numerous projects tend to fade away alongside the advent of new technologies.

Therefore, among the projects submerged or dormant, some possess excellent structure and planning. These projects hold potential to regain attention with new support. Hence, it's crucial to revitalize them by rebuilding them in new directions. This approach can aid in activating these previously potential-driven projects by attracting new prizes or investments.

### Background:
From the members who participated in ETHGlobal 2023, two more people joined, making a total of five people participate in the hackathon.
We brought on one team member who knows Chainlink technology and one backend developer to expand the role on the frontend.
- Project Manager 1
- Front-end developers 2
- Back-end developer 1
- Smart contract developer 1

---
### Track:
- Cross-chain Solutions
- SocialFi innovation
- Tech for good
- Polygon ID
- ENS
- Avalanche

### Project:
> Re-Fresh - To breathe life into a dying project.

Our platform allows for the registration of projects that are no longer being updated or those seeking continual updates, making their introductions and code fully accessible. Users can participate in these projects, collaborating on updates or rebuilding efforts, and share profits with both the original project owners and those involved in the revamped projects through funding.

### Result:
- Award failes

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) Quality of the presentation materials for the presentation video. (+English pronunciation)
2) Additional features are added based on the desired environment for the hackathon.

---
### Positive aspects:
1) The quality of the presentation video was higher than that of the previous hackathon.
2) The schedule was a little more relaxed than previous hackathons.
3) Communication with team members was free.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- Necessity to manage and check development schedule
- Requires configuring business logic for the project
- The importance of creativity, novelty and wow points in ideas
- During Chainlink hackathons, use Chainlink technology as much as possible.
