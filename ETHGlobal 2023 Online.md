## Review of participation in the Second hackathon.

### Overview:
The hackathon was organized by Chainlink and is held annually. 
We met through Discord and decided to form a team consisting only of Koreans.
- 1 PM, 1 frontend developers, 1 backend developer

### Track:
- Chainlink Top Qulity Prizes $20,000 ($500)

### Project:
- Discovey - A social networking service that offers survey and recruiting integration.

### Result:
- ðŸ¥‰ Safe â€” Best Use of Safe{Core} for AA

### Areas for improvement:
Decision-making as a PM role (initial stage)
Quality of the presentation materials for the presentation video. (+English pronunciation)
Lack of awareness regarding the PM role due to it being the first hackathon.

### Positive aspects:
1) Gained understanding of the PM role during the hackathon.
2) Although it took 2 weeks to finalize the idea, the develop timeline progressed as planned without any issues.
3) Direct communication with the develop team members.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
The importance of decision-making and leadership in the PM role.
Need for skills in I.A, product func docs, Wire-Frame, User Flow, and overall project understanding and organization.
The significance of gathering relevant information
