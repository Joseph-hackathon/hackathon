## Review of participation in the Second hackathon.

### Overview:
The hackathon is hosted by ETHGlobal, which holds hackathons in several countries a year.
Among them, I participated in a hackathon that is held online once a year.
We met through KakaoTalk messenger in Korea and decided to form a team comprised entirely of Koreans.
- 1 PM, 1 frontend developers, 1 backend developer

### Track:
- Mask Network - Next.id
- Polygon - zkEvm
- Safe - AA
- Push Protocol

### Project:
- Discovey - A social networking service that offers survey and recruiting integration.

### Result:
- ðŸ¥‰ Safe â€” Best Use of Safe{Core} for AA

### Areas for improvement:
1) Lack of delivery of instructions as a PM role
2) The quality of your presentation material in your presentation video. (+English pronunciation)
3) Lack of awareness of what the team needs

### Positive aspects:
1) The communication skills I learned through the first hackathon helped me communicate a lot.
2) Although there was not enough time to make the final presentation video, the submission was still completed on time.
3) Communication with development team members was free and comfortable, and the hackathon was held together in a good atmosphere.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
1) Necessity for conveying instructions in PM role
2) The project you want to develop must have one checkpoint (wow point): business logic and user needs.
3) Necessity of hackathon schedule management
