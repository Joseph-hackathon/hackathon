### Project:
> ZK-LinkHub

We provide unique email, name service, and website using ZK email. This service has a similar concept to GitHub but offers various features to enhance your online experience.

ZK email provides you with individual email addresses. You can use these addresses to send and receive emails, and if necessary, exchange tokens for more secure communication. Additionally, you can use your email address to create various items such as portfolios, resumes, and diaries.

### Result:
- Award failes

---
### Reason for falling:
- There was no demo site. (Answer received when requesting feedback)

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) It was disappointing that communication was not as prompt as the time zones did not match due to the team members' busy schedules and living in different countries.
2) It was disappointing that I could not upload a demo site where I could actually test it.
3) Integration between front-end and back-end could not be completed.
4) There were many ideas for a credit card payment system based on GHO, but it was disappointing because it was much more complete than our project.
5) It was disappointing that the specific architecture and system structure were not established.

---
### Positive aspects:
- The design of presentation materials to be used during presentations has been slightly improved.
- It seems like leadership has increased a little bit.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I learned about the stablecoin GHO from Abe itself.
- When the topic of stablecoins comes up, I can usually identify trends and trends in the ideas. (credit cards, payment systems, etc.)
- It was fun to communicate with other development team members.
