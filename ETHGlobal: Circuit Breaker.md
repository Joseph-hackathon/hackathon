### Project:
> ZK-LinkHub

We provide unique email, name service, and website using ZK email. This service has a similar concept to GitHub but offers various features to enhance your online experience.

ZK email provides you with individual email addresses. You can use these addresses to send and receive emails, and if necessary, exchange tokens for more secure communication. Additionally, you can use your email address to create various items such as portfolios, resumes, and diaries.

### Result:
- Award failes

---
### Reason for falling:
- There was no demo site. (Answer received when requesting feedback)

---
### Areas for improvement:
1. It was regrettable that although we started the project with a team of five members, communication broke down with two developers midway through, leading to a situation where we couldn't showcase the completed product.

2. We should have proactively sought to supplement the team with replacements for the two developers who dropped out, but unfortunately, we only realized this need later in the project timeline.

3. We felt that our idea lacked originality, scoring only 40% in terms of uniqueness.
  - While we were 60% positive about our idea, we acknowledge that it's something many might have considered before, and similar products already exist. However, we believed ZK-LinkHub stands out as a unique platform service offering.

4. There was a deficiency in understanding the blockchain functionalities and architecture processes.
  - We lacked detailed and in-depth understanding of how blockchain integrates into the intricate processes of ZK-LinkHub.

---
### Positive aspects:
- This time, collaborating with a UX/UI designer for the first time, I was highly satisfied with the quality and design of the presentation materials and prototypes. 
- The designer was incredibly passionate and enjoyed taking on challenges, which made the presentation a success. 
- The her is eagerly wanted to participate in presenting, and the results were very satisfactory. After I shared the overview and processes of the product, her understood it well and smoothly conducted the presentation.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I was able to learn about the role of a designer, communication with a designer, and how to work more efficiently when working with a designer.
(Sites that can be referenced, sharing prototypes in the form of simple sketches, sharing details about what functions or content are included for each page, etc.)
- I learned that pronunciation diction and accuracy are necessary when giving a presentation. (The product must be accurately delivered to the audience.)
- While conducting research to see if there were similar types of products, I referenced and learned a lot from a variety of products. (zkemail, Dmail, etc.)
