### Project:
> Dynamic Boy

A Web3-based game ranking platform allows users to play games and measure rankings for each game, providing them within the platform. These rankings can be viewed by users on our Dynamic Boy platform and can also be uploaded to various social media platforms.

Moreover, regular users can develop games themselves and upload them to the platform. These uploaded games are managed directly by administrators, who can use a dashboard to monitor which games are actively operating, which users hold high rankings in specific games, participation rates, and other diverse statistical information.

### Result:
- Dynamic - $100 and 3 months advanced plan

### Reason for falling (Gave the feedback from ETHGlobal Manager):
1. It sounds like the video is using a voice recorder which doesn't make it sound natural and sometimes mispronounces words. 

2. Video says to share on social media, using Twitter as an example. But given this hackathon was based around Frames and Farcaster, I think using that as the main social media example would have a much more meaningful impact. 

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- Although it wasn't perfect in a short period of 2 nights and 3 days, I was surprised that we were able to develop a platform that could operate normally for one cycle. I also respect the other teams that received awards and think they are amazing.
