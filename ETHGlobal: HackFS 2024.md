**Key Points:**
1) **ENS (Ethereum Name Service) Based Site Creation:** Users can create their own sites through ENS, which converts blockchain addresses into human-readable domain names.
2) **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Storage:** Content created by users is stored on IPFS, a decentralized file storage system that ensures permanent data preservation and easy sharing.
3) **Content Monetization:** Users can generate revenue from their content through various monetization models supported by Filtion.
4) **Local Weather Forecasts:** Using WeatherXM's Explorer, users can get an accurate weather forecast directly on their home page.
5) **Filtion on the Fleek:** Filtion uses Fleek to provide a decentralized execution environment for hosting its Next.js apps.

### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement:
1) I don't think we have made use of the **key points and functional aspects to highlight our project** a little more in ETHGlobal content.
2) It seems that each sponsor track has not been able to effectively completely implement the functional elements that meet the desired requirements.
**For example:** WeatherXM added a widget to the front that displays the date in the area through the user's location information, but failed to implement a front screen that receives the user's information, such as a modal window that obtains the user's location information.
3) As far as I know, there are a lot of web 3.0 notations and blog services using IPFS and ENS. However, we tried to use this on the other hand to highlight user-friendly design UX compared to previous projects, and to bring the functions of Web2 blogs such as WeatherXM to show natural web 3.0 blogs and notions services, but we were disappointed that we did not fully utilize it.
4) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Overall, I am satisfied because the UI/UX is very pretty and beautifully created, and the development was completed as a good project.
- Although I did not have a large part in the hackathon, I am very satisfied because the developer team members communicated with each other and completed the development perfectly.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I believe that the IP industry market has high future value, and I learned that many services in the new IP era are expected to be released in the future.
- I learned that what is important in the IP industry is the creator's ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing, and that the protocol that authenticates and proves them is the story protocol, and that the function to pay royalties accordingly can be included in the contract. I learned.
