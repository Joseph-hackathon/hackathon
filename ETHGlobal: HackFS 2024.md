**Key Points:**
1) **ENS (Ethereum Name Service) Based Site Creation:** Users can create their own sites through ENS, which converts blockchain addresses into human-readable domain names.
2) **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Storage:** Content created by users is stored on IPFS, a decentralized file storage system that ensures permanent data preservation and easy sharing.
3) **Content Monetization:** Users can generate revenue from their content through various monetization models supported by Filtion.
4) **Local Weather Forecasts:** Using WeatherXM's Explorer, users can get an accurate weather forecast directly on their home page.
5) **Filtion on the Fleek:** Filtion uses Fleek to provide a decentralized execution environment for hosting its Next.js apps.

### Areas for improvement:
1) This hackathon was not my idea, but was carried out as an idea from my team members. So it took me a while to understand the idea, and I was disappointed that I couldn't find something I could do.
2) I felt that the creativity of the idea was a little lacking in the 50:50 ratio. This is because 50% helped to quickly introduce the existing Web2 service podcast into the new blockchain market, which develops and upgrades to meet the new web3 trend market, while the remaining 50% was a service that was previously used, so it is a new technology for ideas. I think creativity was very lacking.  This is because it is highly likely that the podcast service had similar ideas to ours.
3) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Overall, I am satisfied because the UI/UX is very pretty and beautifully created, and the development was completed as a good project.
- Although I did not have a large part in the hackathon, I am very satisfied because the developer team members communicated with each other and completed the development perfectly.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I believe that the IP industry market has high future value, and I learned that many services in the new IP era are expected to be released in the future.
- I learned that what is important in the IP industry is the creator's ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing, and that the protocol that authenticates and proves them is the story protocol, and that the function to pay royalties accordingly can be included in the contract. I learned.
