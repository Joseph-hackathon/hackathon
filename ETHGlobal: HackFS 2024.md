**Key Points:**
1) **ENS (Ethereum Name Service) Based Site Creation:** Users can create their own sites through ENS, which converts blockchain addresses into human-readable domain names.
2) **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Storage:** Content created by users is stored on IPFS, a decentralized file storage system that ensures permanent data preservation and easy sharing.
3) **Content Monetization:** Users can generate revenue from their content through various monetization models supported by Filtion.
4) **Local Weather Forecasts:** Using WeatherXM's Explorer, users can get an accurate weather forecast directly on their home page.
5) **Filtion on the Fleek:** Filtion uses Fleek to provide a decentralized execution environment for hosting its Next.js apps.

### Result:
- Filecoin - Honorable Mentions: Prize Pool
- Fleek - Pool Prize

### Feedback from judges:
- **Idea Originality:** While the project concept may not be highly original, its relevance to web3 use cases is strong due to its integration with ENS, IPFS, and Fleek. This shows a clear understanding of web3 technologies.
- **Security and Privacy:** Emphasizing the project's focus on security and privacy is important. Consider detailing specific measures or protocols used to enhance these aspects.
- **Future Plans:** The mention of future ideas is promising. Providing a roadmap or potential next steps could add depth and show the project's potential for growth.

### Areas for improvement:
1) I don't think we have made use of the **key points and functional aspects to highlight our project** a little more in ETHGlobal content.
2) It seems that each sponsor track has not been able to effectively completely implement the functional elements that meet the desired requirements.
   **For example:** WeatherXM added a widget to the front that displays the date in the area through the user's location information, but failed to implement a front screen that receives the user's information, such as a modal window that obtains the user's location information.
3) As far as I know, there are a lot of web 3.0 notations and blog services using IPFS and ENS. However, we tried to use this on the other hand to highlight user-friendly design UX compared to previous projects, and to bring the functions of Web2 blogs such as WeatherXM to show natural web 3.0 blogs and notions services, but we were disappointed that we did not fully utilize it.
4) English presentation required
5) I wanted to add a function that automatically generates AI images using the LilyPad and can be used for content, but I couldn't put it in the initial plan and tried to put it in the second half, but it was a shame that I couldn't put it in because the schedule was not working.

This is thought to have caused such a small problem because it did not quickly plan for schedule management and additional functions and did not properly grasp them.

### Positive aspects:
- Since I teamed up with the designer, I was very satisfied with the front-end screen that was more complete and could be commercialized.
- I was satisfied with the results that came out in the direction I wanted because I understood the ideas I planned and came up with in the early stages.

It was my initial plan to build my own blog and nonion services using ENS name services suitable for Web 3.0, and the contents are stored in IPFS, transparent and permanently stored, and are equipped with text colors, image uploads, and content generation functions through AI, just as they use blogs and nonions to share their contents with many people and create content.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- In a project called Fleek, I learned this time that there was content that helped the hosting service using next.js.
- Previously, I thought it would be nice to have an environmental blockchain service related to weather and climate, but through this hackathon, I learned that a project called WeatherXM provides clear data such as global climate, temperature, global warming, and humidity within the sponsor track. I also learned that there is a hardware service in the form of climate measurement Wi-Fi.
- While designing at this hackathon, we developed the front end together, and it was a form that we progressed in an agile form, and we experienced that it progressed faster. However, if the design is delayed, the front end will be delayed, and if we cannot communicate with each other, the design and the front may proceed in different directions, so I learned with the thought that it may be safe to complete the design work first and then proceed with the front work.
