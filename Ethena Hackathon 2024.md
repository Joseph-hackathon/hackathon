## Project

### Motivation

> **A New Approach to Prediction Markets**
  - Rather than solving existing problems or focusing on specific limitations of current prediction markets, we are driven by the opportunity to explore and expand the marketability of this space.
  - Our aim is to innovate within the prediction market domain by leveraging emerging trends and technologies.

> **Inspired by Polymarket, Enhanced by Ethena**
  - Inspired by popular and trendy services like Polymarket, we are developing a prediction market within the **`Ethena ecosystem`**.
  - By incorporating various advanced technologies, we aim to differentiate our platform and offer users a unique experience.

> **Delivering an Advanced and Enjoyable Service**
  - Through **`Ethena Prediction`**, we showcase the technical capabilities of the Ethena ecosystem.
  - While maintaining familiar elements, we integrate diverse Web3 technologies to provide a more engaging and advanced prediction market service that sets us apart from existing solutions.

### Key Features

#### **1. USDe-based Payment and Reward System (Ethena)**  
- **Description**: Maps USDe to **sUSDe tokens** on a 1:1 basis for staking and payments within the platform.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Enhances the value of prediction options and fosters **P2P liquidity** through transactions.  
  - Increases overall platform transaction volume and user engagement.  
- **Additional Benefits**:  
  - **sUSDe's annualized return of 16.8%** maximizes deposit and transaction incentives.  
  - The high reward structure mitigates risks for long-term predictions, encouraging user participation and boosting market liquidity.  

#### **2. ERC-1155 for Market Diversity**  
- **Description**: Employs **ERC-1155 tokens** to represent prediction market positions, enabling users to manage multiple assets within a single contract.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Reduces gas fees and improves efficiency for creating, holding, and trading diverse prediction outcomes.  
  - Enhances user experience by simplifying asset management across varied market predictions.  

#### **3. Multi-chain Support (LayerZero Developing)**  
- **Description**: Integrates **LayerZero protocol** to enable USDe usage across multiple blockchain networks.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Offers seamless multi-chain functionality, expanding access to users across various ecosystems.  
  - Ensures interoperability for prediction market operations on diverse blockchain networks.  

#### **4. Real-time Data Insights via Subgraphs (Goldsky)**  
- **Description**: Utilizes **Goldsky-powered subgraphs** to provide real-time updates on ERC standard transactions and data.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Delivers accurate, real-time information for users and enhances the transparency of prediction markets.  
  - Enables seamless monitoring and analytics for active market participants.

### Result
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement
1) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- Although the function to bridge the EVM chain was not fully implemented within the period, the code was structured to a certain extent, and when pitching this, the goal and timeline of continuous development were clearly set, so the EVM side chain was launched. I'm glad I was able to get good results on the track.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- I learned that the results may vary depending on the presentation, presentation materials, and document content. We did not receive any awards when we submitted this service to the previous Ripple hackathon. However, this time, we reorganized again, revised and submitted presentation materials and documents, and were able to obtain good results.
- I think it is a good idea to analyze and make a strategic decision about the track you choose when submitting. We submitted the Non-EVM track in the previous hackathon, but this time we chose and submitted the EVM track and got good results.
