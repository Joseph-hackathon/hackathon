## Review of participation in the fourth hackathon.

### Overview:
We aim to establish a new paradigm in the cryptocurrency market, not merely to address current issues but to achieve consensus between the existing world and the unfolding future. In the current Web2 landscape, convenient payment systems exist through various applications. These are typically integrated with banks, card companies, and payment gateways, requiring user registration within each application. The evolution of payment systems from offline to online in Web2 has resulted in the current user experience (UX)-enhanced convenient payment systems.

### Project:
> GCLC - GHO Credit Loan Card

Our goal is to introduce cryptocurrencies into this convenient payment system and enable payments using GHO stablecoins. Moreover, the GHO payment system goes beyond simple transactions it aims to allow users to register and conduct payments using a credit loan card in the form of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token). This NFT card can be easily used for payments. By offering such a payment system, seek to establish a new paradigm in the Web3 ecosystem that coexists harmoniously with the existing Web2 ecosystem.

### Result:
- Award failes

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) It was disappointing that communication was not as prompt as the time zones did not match due to the team members' busy schedules and living in different countries.
2) It was disappointing that I could not upload a demo site where I could actually test it.
3) Integration between front-end and back-end could not be completed.
4) There were many ideas for a credit card payment system based on GHO, but it was disappointing because it was much more complete than our project.
5) It was disappointing that the specific architecture and system structure were not established.

---
### Positive aspects:
1) The quality of the presentation video was higher than that of the previous hackathon.
2) The schedule was a little more relaxed than previous hackathons.
3) Communication with team members was free.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- Necessity to manage and check development schedule
- Requires configuring business logic for the project
- The importance of creativity, novelty and wow points in ideas
- During Chainlink hackathons, use Chainlink technology as much as possible.
