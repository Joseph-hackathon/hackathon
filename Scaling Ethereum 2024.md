### Project:
> Complace

**Web 3.0 E-commerce Marketplace**
We offer various existing e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Shopify in a Web3 format. This platform operates in a decentralized manner, providing personalized markets tailored to individual sellers, enabling them to sell their products.

Sellers can create and register their own stores, and they have the option to set commissions directly for their products.

Buyers can browse products from multiple sellers and proceed with purchases using tokens. The reliability of these products can be verified through ETHSIGN's registered store sales registration certificates and product certificates. Additionally, information regarding the shipping process and detailed source information for the products is transparently provided using blockchain-based data.

While this may resemble NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, and BackPack in the Web3 space, we offer a broader range of products for purchase and sale beyond just NFTs in an e-commerce format.

### Result:
- *üèÉFilecoin*: Decentralize your dApps with Filecoin - Runner Ups

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) TBA
4) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- It started with two developers, but one of them was unable to participate due to personal reasons, so we worked with one developer until the end and did our best to produce a good demo, so I was satisfied and grateful.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I learned that if we continue to communicate with developers and remind them of the development direction, we may be able to install more necessary MVP features as a priority.
- I thought and learned that one strategy and direction would be to understand in more detail what the sponsor track wants and provide services tailored to that sponsor track.
