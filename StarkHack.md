**Key Points:**
1) **Automated Reward Harvesting and Reinvestment**
   - **Automation with Keeper:** Utilize a **keeper to automate the process of harvesting rewards and reinvesting** them. This means users only need to deposit tokens once, and the system will **automatically handle the harvesting of rewards and reinvestment of STRK** or any other applicable tokens.
   - **Efficiency:** Automating these processes ensures rewards are harvested and reinvested as soon as possible, maximizing yield and reducing the manual effort required by users.

3) **Simplified User Interface**
   - **Deposit Function:** A straightforward function allowing users to deposit funds into the vault.
   - **Withdraw Function:** A function that enables users to withdraw their initial deposits along with any rewards earned, simplifying the user‚Äôs interaction with the system.

### Result:
- Failed

---
### Feedback from judges:
- Not yet

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) We were unable to complete the project perfectly within the given timeframe. On the final submission day, we uploaded the demo site, but it only contained the front-end code. The smart contract part was not integrated, making it effectively not a functional demo site. This was very disappointing.
2) The smart contract was also not fully completed within the timeframe. Therefore, we could not demonstrate the core functions of our project, such as the automated harvesting and restaking that rely on the keeper. This was another major disappointment.
3) Since Cairo is the native language of StarkNet, the development team had to study it while participating in the competition. As a result, we couldn't progress quickly and had to balance studying with actual code development.
4) During the competition, there were several times when we sought feedback from the judges on our project. We spent a considerable amount of time on this. While receiving feedback is beneficial as it can make our project more robust and improved, it also meant we had to frequently modify our project. This could lead to changes in direction, potentially compromising our original ideas and creativity. In hindsight, spending too much time on feedback might have been a problem and a point of regret.

### Positive aspects:
1) Despite having to study Cairo, the native language of StarkNet, while participating in the competition, we managed to achieve nearly 90% completion within the given timeframe. I am grateful to and impressed by the development team for their hard work. Because of this effort, we were able to show the smart contract code on GitHub to the judges.
2) Initially, our understanding of the StarkNet ecosystem was limited, and we struggled to identify exactly what was needed. However, as we progressed through the competition, we gained a better understanding of StarkNet and identified why our project would be valuable to the ecosystem. This improved understanding allowed us to complete the project to a significant extent by giving our best effort until the end.

### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- The StarkNet ecosystem is still not very active. Researching and exploring the ecosystem reveals that there aren't many projects; it mainly consists of basic DeFi services, wallet services, and explorer projects.
- In the StarkNet ecosystem, wallet services seem to be more active and receive more attention because StarkNet natively supports Account Abstraction (AA). Unlike other networks, which primarily focus on DeFi services with high liquidity, StarkNet appears to have more prominent and well-regarded wallet services.
- Since the current ecosystem is quite small, it seems like they are trying to expand it through hackathons. The foundation's direct participation as a sponsor track and the provision of grants indicate their intention to support and grow the ecosystem in the future.
