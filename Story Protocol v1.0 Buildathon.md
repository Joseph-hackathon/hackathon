**Key Points:**
An integrated podcast platform for creators and podcast listeners. Creators can use the StoryPods dapp to register their episodes as an IP and license it. Another creator can easily remix this episode and create a derivate of it. Users can tip an episode they love and this revenue is shared among the creators according to the royalty terms.

### Result:
- Not Yet

### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement:
1) This hackathon was not my idea, but was carried out as an idea from my team members. So it took me a while to understand the idea, and I was disappointed that I couldn't find something I could do.
2) I felt that the creativity of the idea was a little lacking in the 50:50 ratio. This is because 50% helped to quickly introduce the existing Web2 service podcast into the new blockchain market, which develops and upgrades to meet the new web3 trend market, while the remaining 50% was a service that was previously used, so it is a new technology for ideas. I think creativity was very lacking.  This is because it is highly likely that the podcast service had similar ideas to ours.
3) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Overall, I am satisfied because the UI/UX is very pretty and beautifully created, and the development was completed as a good project.
- Although I did not have a large part in the hackathon, I am very satisfied because the developer team members communicated with each other and completed the development perfectly.
---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- I believe that the IP industry market has high future value, and I learned that many services in the new IP era are expected to be released in the future.
- I learned that what is important in the IP industry is the creator's ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing, and that the protocol that authenticates and proves them is the story protocol, and that the function to pay royalties accordingly can be included in the contract. I learned.
