### Overview:
Suirang aims to create a comprehensive platform that visualizes transaction activity and asset information for various games within the web3 ecosystem. 
The platform enables users to easily check rankings and asset statuses for each game, engage with the community, and participate in airdrop events.

**Key Points:**
Visualizes **transaction activity and asset information** for various games within the web3 ecosystem. 
This allows users to **easily check rankings and asset statuses** for each game, while also engaging them with airdrop events.

### Result:
- Zetta Block: 🥇 1st Place

---
### Reason for falling (Feedback from judges):
- Not yet

---
### Areas for improvement:
1) Among the game metadata values included in the contract, if the value that can be used as "Feature" had been specifically set, the developers could have proceeded with the development more conveniently, but it was a pity that I could not set the value specifically.
2) There was a lack of information and study on the mechanisms for Sui smart contracts and the metadata values included.
3) English presentation required

---
### Positive aspects:
- Before participating in the Sui Hackathon, I participated in the Celestia Hackathon. So, I participated in the Sui Hackathon just 2 days after it ended, so the team members were all exhausted, but they still did their best until the end and finished with a good result, so it was nice to be able to get such a good result.
- There was no professional front-end developer, but the contract developer wanted to try the front-end, so this was my first time working properly on the front-end. He shared "Gam3.gg" as a reference with very good quality, and it was very similar to the platform. I think there were good results because the front-end was developed well.
- Even though this was the first time using an API called Zettablock, the backend developer stayed up all night developing it, analyzing the contract, selecting “Features” related to game metadata within the contract, and providing only those parts to Zettablock as an API. I think we got good results by using it to display only the desired data values ​​after data filtering.

---
### Things I learned from the hackathon:
- Since I only knew the Sui ecosystem as a concept as a network specialized for games, I was thinking of an idea as a game-related project, so while doing research with the development team members, I was checking the smart contract for transactions that occurred in Sui Explorer. I was very surprised to see that it contained methods (or functions) related to game metadata, and this was the first time I learned about it.
- The function called “Package ID” within the contract allows us to know that the game contains various metadata for various rankings, levels, characters, etc. and is related to game-related data, so we can filter data based on “Package ID” to filter the game. Metadata values ​​are displayed on the front.
