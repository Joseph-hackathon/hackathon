### Motivation
Our motivation for the Ripple Market project is to create a secure, global P2P secondhand trading platform inspired by Danggeun Market. 
By using Ripple (XRP) for fast, low-cost payments, we aim to make Web3 accessible to everyday users, enabling safe and affordable local transactions worldwide.

### Result
- ü•â 3rd Place

### Reason for falling (Feedback from IBC Protocol judges)
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement
1) Because of the lack of knowledge about IBC technology, there were many inconveniences and difficulties in configuring the architecture at this Ideathon. In addition, it was difficult to combine the blockchain IBC protocol with network communication data without much knowledge of TCP/IP network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS. We completed the architecture by referring to reference materials and other principles in a format that was as plausible and functional as possible.
2) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- Since there were not many team members with technical knowledge and all team members had good business-related skills and abilities such as copywriters, technical aspects were important in this Ideathon, but the direction and method of emphasizing and expressing the business aspects of the idea were very important. I think we were able to produce a good result because we were outstanding and had strong and diverse ways to appeal to the judges.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- I learned what the IBC protocol is and what technologies it provides.
- I learned that the IBC protocol is a cross-chain and Cosmos hub ecosystem, and that their goal is similar to the blockchain Internet protocol and is to provide a hub (router)-like role in the blockchain ecosystem.
