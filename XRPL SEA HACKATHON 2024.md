### Motivation
Our motivation for the Ripple Market project is to create a secure, global P2P secondhand trading platform inspired by Danggeun Market. 
By using Ripple (XRP) for fast, low-cost payments, we aim to make Web3 accessible to everyday users, enabling safe and affordable local transactions worldwide.

- **Secure and Accessible Trading:** Supports secondhand goods transactions with escrow protection and easy access through social login and fiat on-ramp.
- **Multi-Network Compatibility:** Bridge feature enables cross-network transactions for flexibility.
- **Flexible Payment Options:** Allows token swaps between stablecoins and other tokens for convenient payments.

### Result
- ü•â 3rd Place

### Reason for falling (Feedback from XRPL judges)
- "The idea is very interesting, as it allows people to transact real goods with crypto or digital assets. The other challenge is solving the regulatory aspect and how to navigate regulations to ensure it can legally operate in various jurisdictions.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis product would be appealing if users need a borderless payment method, but it will require strong management for the delivery of physical goods. Overall, I'm really looking forward to the development of this product.‚Äù

### Areas for improvement
1) English presentation required.

### Positive aspects
- Although the function to bridge the EVM chain was not fully implemented within the period, the code was structured to a certain extent, and when pitching this, the goal and timeline of continuous development were clearly set, so the EVM side chain was launched. I'm glad I was able to get good results on the track.

### Things I learned from the hackathon
- I learned that the results may vary depending on the presentation, presentation materials, and document content. We did not receive any awards when we submitted this service to the previous Ripple hackathon. However, this time, we reorganized again, revised and submitted presentation materials and documents, and were able to obtain good results.
- I think it is a good idea to analyze and make a strategic decision about the track you choose when submitting. We submitted the Non-EVM track in the previous hackathon, but this time we chose and submitted the EVM track and got good results.
