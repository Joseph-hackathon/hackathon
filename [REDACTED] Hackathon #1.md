# [REDACTED] Hackathon
`Review of participation in the 21 hackathon.`

[Demo](https://reception-seven.vercel.app/) | [Pitchdeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gn9eo1JHbGmijGPWTwsq1gkfCLY_8rKp/view?usp=sharing) | [Github](https://github.com/Julius-Ky/reCeption) | [Video](https://youtu.be/puJjyTeLRjY)

## Overview
**reCEPTION** is an AI-powered security platform that offers functionality similar to reCAPTCHA, providing automated verification solutions for both Web2 and Web3 environments. The project aims to enhance the security and quality of smart contracts and provide automated validation solutions for users and developers.

<br></br>

1. **AI-Based Smart Contract Analysis**:
    - Users upload their smart contract code for analysis, where AI identifies security vulnerabilities, code flaws, and potential scams.
2. **Automated Security Checks and Corrections**:
    - Based on the analysis, the AI suggests and implements modifications, including security patches and performance optimizations.
    - Provides a feature to automatically deploy the modified code within the platform.
3. **Detailed Reporting**:
    - Generates comprehensive reports detailing the issues found, modifications made, and explanations to help users understand improvements.
    - Reports are available for download in CSV and PDF formats.
4. **Admin Console**:
    - An admin console allows administrators to set up and manage reCeption features on their own websites.
    - Supports reCAPTCHA-like functionality for security validation on web pages.
5. **API Provision**:
    - Offers API access to analysis results and data, enabling e-commerce platforms or Web3 applications to use these as security solutions.

### Result
- Not yet

### Reason for falling (Feedback from Aptos judges)
- Not yet

### Areas for improvement
1) We completed all of the smart contracts and AI models for each part, but in the process of integrating with the front end, there was a problem with the integration of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãmodel due to the high usage environment on PCs such as GPUs, so it was unfortunate that it could not be completed as a perfect platform.
2) This Near Protocol Hackathon had many sponsored tracks that focused on AI technology, which was the core of this hackathon, but among the sponsored tracks, we used **ZettaBlock** and **Public AI**'s API to import on-chain data and train it in our AI model to model it. We tried to improve and collect and pre-process a lot of data, but there was not enough data related to the vulnerabilities we wanted, and there was a problem integrating the API, so it was disappointing that we could not utilize the sponsor tracks.
3) Our MVP was to complete all of the API docs page, file upload page, and admin console page, but this MVP was not in a phase that could be completed within the period and had many overloaded functions, so it was difficult to manage these schedules. As a product manager, I was a bit lacking and was disappointed.
4) English presentation required.
