1. **AI-Based Smart Contract Analysis**:
    - Users upload their smart contract code for analysis, where AI identifies security vulnerabilities, code flaws, and potential scams.
2. **Automated Security Checks and Corrections**:
    - Based on the analysis, the AI suggests and implements modifications, including security patches and performance optimizations.
    - Provides a feature to automatically deploy the modified code within the platform.
3. **Detailed Reporting**:
    - Generates comprehensive reports detailing the issues found, modifications made, and explanations to help users understand improvements.
    - Reports are available for download in CSV and PDF formats.
4. **Admin Console**:
    - An admin console allows administrators to set up and manage reCeption features on their own websites.
    - Supports reCAPTCHA-like functionality for security validation on web pages.
5. **API Provision**:
    - Offers API access to analysis results and data, enabling e-commerce platforms or Web3 applications to use these as security solutions.
